```

# Technologies and tools

## Tech stacks

TypeScript, React, WebSockets, Node.js, Vite, Jest, HMTL, CSS

## Libraries

- [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - for generating a unique code for every user
- [React Use Websocket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-websocket) - to manage WebSocket connections
- [React Simple WYSIWYG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-wysiwyg) - for a lightweight WYSIWYG editor

# How the requirements are met (and whatâ€™s missing)

âœ… Set up client-side and WebSocket servers <br>
âœ… Created modularized React components <br>
âœ… Enabled user login functionality <br>
âœ… Created the layout for a real-time collaborative text editor, which includes a list of avatars for current users, a simple text editor, and an activity log <br>
âœ… Set up the necessary dependencies for testing <br>
ðŸš§ Unit tests & integration tests <br>
ðŸš§ WebSocket connection <br>
ðŸš§ Proper typing (currently using a few `any` as placeholders) <br>
ðŸš§ Styling <br>
ðŸš§ Handling edge cases (for example, when multiple users type in the editor simultaneously ) <br>
ðŸš§ Deploy on Vercel <br>

# Area for improvement

If I had more time and this was a real product, I would have spent more time on the planning and researching phase. For planning, I would have gone deeper into drawing out the wireframe and planning for edge cases. As for research, I would have researched more React text editor libraries.

I would also spent time debugging my webSocket connectio issues and properly typing the variables. Also, throughout the development process, I would have made more commits and used different feature branches for creating different features.
